Statement Coverage ensures that every line of code (or statement) in a program has been executed at least once during testing. It helps in verifying that no part of the code is left untested but does not account for the logical flow or decision-making processes within the program.

Branch Coverage extends statement coverage by ensuring that all possible branches in decision-making structures (like if and switch statements) are tested. This checks whether each possible path of the program's flow has been executed, ensuring thorough testing of conditional statements.

Predicate Coverage focuses on the individual conditions within complex logical expressions. It tests all combinations of boolean values in these conditions, ensuring that every possible true/false outcome is covered, providing a deeper layer of verification in scenarios with multiple conditions.
